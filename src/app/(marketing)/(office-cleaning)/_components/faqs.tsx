            answer: `Regular cleaning is a touch-up clean for clients who need their homes maintained on a weekly, fortnightly, or monthly basis.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'How long does a deep clean typically take?',
            answer: `The duration of a deep clean depends on the size of the property, but typically takes anywhere from 4-8 hours for an average-sized home. Our experienced teams work efficiently to provide a thorough, top-to-bottom clean in a timely manner.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'How many your cleaners will come to clean my house?',
            answer: `Our standard consists of a team of two cleaners, with the possibility of an additional team member joining as required. However, for smaller tasks such as Studio, 1BR, 2BR, or touch-up jobs, one person may be assigned.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I request a specific cleaner?',
            answer: `Absolutely! We obtain a tonne of clients through word of mouth. If the person who referred you used a specific cleaner, we can amend their schedule so they'll be able to clean your home.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I stay home during the cleaning process?',
            answer: 'Certainly, you can remain at home during the deep cleaning process if you prefer. However, many clients choose to run errands or be out of the house to allow our experienced team to work uninterrupted and complete the job efficiently.',
        },
        {
            question: `What is your cancellation policy?`,
            answer: 'For cancellations, please provide us with a 24-hour notice to avoid a late cancellation fee. Our cleaning teamsâ€™ schedules are meticulously planned, and cancellations within 24 hours of service result in lost work opportunities for them.',
        },
