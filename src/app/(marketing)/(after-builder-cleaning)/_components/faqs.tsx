            question: 'What is after builder cleaning?',
            answer: `After builder cleaning, also known as post-construction cleaning, is a specialized cleaning service that is performed once construction or renovation work is completed in a residential or commercial property. It involves a thorough cleaning process to remove all the dust, debris, and residue left behind by the construction activities.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'How long does after builder cleaning take?',
            answer: `The duration of after builder cleaning depends on the size of the property and the extent of construction work. A quick rule of thumb is to match the number of bedrooms with the estimated hours needed (e.g. 3 bedrooms would typically require around 3 hours)`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Are your cleaning teams professionals insured?',
            answer: 'Every member of our exceptional cleaning team is fully insured, safeguarding you and your property while delivering unparalleled cleaning solutions.',
        },
        {
            question: 'How many your cleaners will come to clean my house?',
            answer: `Our standard consists of a team of two cleaners, with the possibility of an additional team member joining as required. However, for smaller tasks such as Studio, 1BR, 2BR, or touch-up jobs, one person may be assigned.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Are cleaning supplies provided?',
            answer: `Yes, ${siteConfig.name}'s cleaning teams provide all necessary cleaning supplies and equipment for a seamless and hassle-free experience.`,
        },
        {
            question: 'Can I get a same-day booking?',
            answer: 'No assurance for same-day bookings, but we often meet the request depending on the day.',
        },
        {
            question: `What is your cancellation policy?`,
            answer: 'For cancellations, please provide us with a 24-hour notice to avoid a late cancellation fee. Our cleaning teamsâ€™ schedules are meticulously planned, and cancellations within 24 hours of service result in lost work opportunities for them.',
        },
    ];
